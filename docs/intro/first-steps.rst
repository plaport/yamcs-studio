First Steps
===========


Launching Yamcs Studio
----------------------

When you launch Yamcs Studio for the first time it will ask you to choose a workspace. A **workspace** is where you store your resources (e.g. a display file).

With Yamcs Studio, you are always working on one workspace at a time. Usually workspaces are fairly static, and you can often do with just one of them.

    :align: center

Choose your preferred location, and click **OK**.


Empty Workspace
---------------

Yamcs Studio is now launched and you should see an empty workspace with the default window arrangement:

    :alt: Empty Workspace
    :align: center

The empty area in the middle is where displays will open.

Yamcs Studio has two different windows. :doc:`../display-builder/index` and :doc:`../display-runner/index`. When Yamcs Studio is launched for the first time on a new workspace the user will be welcomed with the Display Builder window.


Example Project
---------------

Yamcs Studio comes with a demo project that contains many examples
on how to use any of the available widgets. To add this project to your
workspace choose **File > New > Example...**, then **OPI Examples**.
